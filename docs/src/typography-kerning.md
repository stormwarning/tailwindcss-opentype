## Usage

Although a well-designed typeface has consistent inter-glyph spacing overall, some glyph combinations require adjustment for improved legibility. If the `letter-spacing` property is defined, kerning adjustments are considered part of the default spacing and letter spacing adjustments are made _after_ kerning has been applied.

### Kerning :feat[kern]

```html emerald
<template preview>
    <p class="font-warnock text-4xl opacity-70 kerning-none">You Will Try</p>
    <p class="font-warnock text-4xl kerning">
        <mark>Yo</mark>u <mark>Wi</mark>ll <mark>Try</mark>
    </p>
</template>

<p class="**kerning**">You Will Try</p>
```

Kerning often defaults to `auto` in the browser, which may disable kerning at smaller font sizes. It can be disabled manually if needed using `.kerning-none`, or force-enabled using `.kerning-normal`.
