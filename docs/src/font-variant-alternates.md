## Usage

Use the `font-variant-alternates` utilities to access alternative styles for different characters. These can be applied to blocks of text, in the case of historical forms or stylesets, or to individual characters, as with swash glyphs or character variants.

### Historical forms {{ 'hist' | badge }}

Historical glyph variants arenâ€™t likely to be useful in everyday typesetting situations, but may prove useful when referencing the past.

```
<p class="historical-forms">Blasphemous</p>
